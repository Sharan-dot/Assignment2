One of my favorite memories was the adoption fair held in October. The whole community came together to support the shelter, and I got to see several animals find loving homes that day. One family, in particular, adopted a shy, older cat named Whiskers. I had spent time helping her adjust and socialize, and seeing her go to a caring family was a highlight for me. It reinforced the importance of my work and made all the hard tasks worth it.
